ServerConfig.xml needs to be in the same folder as any executable built with kuros. It is read by the kuros Server at creation. Important values are port and buffersize. Default buffersize is 1024, try increasing this if you experience lots of broken xml messages. 

trajectory.txt is used in some of the demos and needs to be in the same folder as those executables.
